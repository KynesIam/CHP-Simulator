# CHP-Simulator
Simulates clifford dynamics with measurements
This code allows for the simulation of the clifford group unitaries which include CNOT gates, phase gates, Hadamard gates and swap gates.  

The code also allows for measurements in the computational basis. 

The entanglement entropy can be calculated with relative efficiency by finding the rank of a binary matrix.

This code is based off results from the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406196 "Improved Simulation of Stabilizer Circuits" by Scott Aaronson and Daniel Gottesman.
